      <p class="p-4"><b>Effects of Deforestation and Depletion of Vegetation on Environmental Settings in Tertiary Hills of Bangladesh:
         Case Study on Greater Districts of Chittagong and Chittagong Hill Tracts</b></p>
     <p class="p-4">The research deals with the changes in soil, landform, surface and ground water, micro climate, endemic flora-fauna and human settlement after destruction of natural forest.</p>
     <p class="p-4">Adopted method is mainly RGA (Rapid Geographical Appraisal) and the techniques are group discussion, PRA sessions, PRA Time Trend Analysis, checklist survey, key individual’s interview, transect, direct observation, temperature and humidity record, soil sample analysis, physical mapping and some innovative techniques as per objective.</p>
     <p class="p-4">The unique and striking matter of this research is that it reveals the changes in environment due to different forestry operation, i.e., traditional jhum practice, modern very short interval slash and burn agriculture, deliberate logging and commercial plantations.</p>
     <p class="p-4">Every forest operation shows significant changes in soil and other environmental components. It reveals that changes in soil cause changes in other components—thus soil is the key control of environment and conservation of soil is the secret of environmental stability.</p>

      <h3 class="h4-1">The research finally includes following matters:</h3>
